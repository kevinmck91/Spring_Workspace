	You can reference the beans properties in an external file as opposed to keeping them in the beans.xml file
	
	Placeholders can be used instead in the beans.xml
	
		<bean id="pointA" class="org.javabrains.Point">
			<property name="x" value="${pointA.pointX}"/>
			<property name="y" value="${pointA.pointY}"/>
		</bean>
		
	you have to let spring know that the values have to be substituted
	
		<bean class ="org.springframework.beans.factory.config.PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer" ></bean>
		
		This is an "out of the box" class that allows spring to search for the properties file and replace the values in the XML
		we also need to define the location of this properties file
		the properites file has to be in the same location as the xml file
