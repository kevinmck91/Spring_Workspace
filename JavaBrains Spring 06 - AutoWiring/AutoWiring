	byName
	
		Allows us to skip some of the configuration that we have to do. 
		IE. we have to specify the reference from the bean being called to the other beans that are being injected into the bean being called.
		
		The name of the Bean must be the same as the name variable that we are trying to set
		
		Add the tag : autowire="byName
		<bean id="triangle" class="org.javabrains.Triangle" autowire="byName">
		
		When spring sees autowire="byName" in the triangle bean, it checks the names of the variable in the triangle class then searches through the XML for a bean of the same name to references it
	
	byType
		
		If you have only one member variable of point and only one bean of type point then you can autowire byType
	
	Constructor
	
		Does the same as autowire byType but instead of doing the Setter Injection, it does the Constructor Injection. You can still only have one bean per type 
		
	
	Autowiring is not recommended for a large amounts of beans as its hard to track what spring is doing
