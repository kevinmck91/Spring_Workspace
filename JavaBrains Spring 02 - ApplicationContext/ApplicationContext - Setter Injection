	ApplicationContext - Setter Injection

	ApplicationContext does everything the bean factory does and more
	ApplicationContext is also an interface and has different implimentaions depending on the config
	ClassPathXmlApplicationContext - you don't need to pass a file resource, a String will do.
	You will need the move the spring.xml to the classpath (inside the scr folder)
	Use the spring.xml to set the value of 'type' from within the triangle
	Set the type via the property tag in the xml
	Spring is using the setter in order to inject the type property into the object (setting injection)
