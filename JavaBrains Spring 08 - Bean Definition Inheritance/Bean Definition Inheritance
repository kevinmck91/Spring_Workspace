	If you have a hundreds of beans with different definitions for all of them, yet you have a common set of values that will be set on multiple beans
	You can have one bean with all the common bean definitions and the other beans can inherit the aspects from the parent bean (it can be a bean in itself or an abstract bean template)
	
		parentTriangle bean defines one of the 3 points
		you can have multiple beans which inherit from this parent triangle 
		you can inherit the parent properties in the child bean, or overwrite them
		
		If the parent bean is set up as a list, the child bean can inherit and add to the list
		The child bean can overwrite the parent list by defining a list or it can add to the parent list by by defining the list as :
	
		<list merge="true">
			<ref bean="pointB">
		</list>
