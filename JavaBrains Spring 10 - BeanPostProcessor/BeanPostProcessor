	BeanPostProcessor are classes that tell spring there is some method that need to run after creating the bean.
	
	The code in the BeanPostProcessor will run after spring has initilized every bean. 
	
	- The Method will run for every initilization of every bean 
	- BeanPostProcessor is a separate class
	
	Write a class containing two methods to print the bean name after every bean has been initilized. 
	
	The method is an interface and takes two parameters. The bean object is passed and the name of the bean in the XML is passed in
	The method does something or to the object 
	The method will return any object to continue the object config
	The BeanPostProcessor has to be declared in the XML. having the class is not enough
	
	@Override
		public Object postProcessAfterInitialization(Object bean, String beanName)
				throws BeansException {
			System.out.println("In after initizilation method. Bean name is : " + beanName );
			return bean;
		}
		
	
	in order to impliment this in the spring.xml:
	<bean class="org.javabrains.DisplayNameBeanPostProcessor"></bean>
	and this is enough
