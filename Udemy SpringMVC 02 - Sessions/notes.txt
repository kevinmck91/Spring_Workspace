1. Create a Dynamic Web Project. Including the Web.xml file

2. Create an Index.jsp and test that it works.

3. Convert to a Maven project and add the required Jars for Spring to the POM.xml

4. 	Create a dispatcher Servlet which routes the traffic.
	Right click project and click new Servlet.
	Add Existing servlet and this lets you choose the Spring Dispatcher Servlet from the WebMVC jar
	The Servlet is actually only code added to the Web.xml.
	Change the Display name and servlet name to 'offers'
	Add the <load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup> tag
	The Servlet-mapping routes the traffic using the URL
	
5.	Spring is automatically going to try load XML beans from a pre-configured directory in Web-inf.
	We create a Spring Bean Config.xml file in that location with the same name as the dispatcher Servlet.
	offers-servlet.xml
	
6.	Be sure that the project Maven Jars are included in the Deployment assembly so the server can read them

7.	We should have a controller for every section of our website.
	Create a controller (bean) that returns a string with the annotation @RequestMapping("/")
	We want spring to load this controller as a Bean. This is done by adding NameSpaces (schema) to the offers-servlet.xml 
	We also add <context:component-scan and  <mvc:annotation-driven> to the file
	This can be typed or inserted using the GUI
	
8. 	The dispatcher servlet needs a name to convert into a View to display 
	we will use the jar org.springframework.web.servlet.view.InternalResourceViewResolver.class to resolve the return string.
	we will add that class to the dispatcher servlet servlet.xml class so the Dispatcher Servlet knows what to do with the returned string
	
	========= Summary =========

	The Beans configured in the offers-servlet.xml (bean config) file are loaded up as the program loads. Annotations are scanned for
	The Dispatcher Servlet checks the request and forwards the request to the class via the Annotation. The controller Class is returning the string to the Servlet
	The Dispatcher Servlet then uses the View Resolver to append and prepend the view to show .../home.jsp


======== PART 2 ========

1.	We want to now use the controller to pass data from the Session to the JSP

2. 	Add the session object to the method as an argument to the Method of the controller that defined PAGE1. 
	This is now available in our Jsp via Java using the Session.getAttribute tag
	
3. 	In the PAGE2 method controller, create the object ModelAndView and pass the name of the page as the ViewResolver name.
	The default sessions expiry time is about 10 minutes
	
4. 	In the PAGE3 method controller, create the object Model is passed to the controller.
	Was can use this within our method and add to the session
	Using naked expression language means that the special charactors are interpreted as HTML in the output
	
5. 	In the PAGE4, import the JSTL Tag lib via Maven and the TAGLIB in the Html file. 
	Using JSTL means that the special charactors are not interpreted as HTML in the output
