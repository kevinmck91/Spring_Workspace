	SpringDemo18 - Using MessageSource To Get Text From Property Files
	
	Rather than having alert messages within the code. They can be accessed via an external property file (Using Application Context)	
	This is the bean that access the property file : 
	
		<bean id="messageSource" class="org.springframework.context.support.ResourceBundleMessageSource">
			<property name="basenames">
				<list>
					<value>mymessages</value>
				</list>
			</property>
		</bean>

	This is used to pick messages out of out file. Spring will seach through the classpath for a file of name "mymessages"
	
	The actual code is written in the the App Class. Takes in 4 parameters
		context.getMessage(Key, Args[], Default message, local)
		
	We can also access message from within a class by creating a variable and injecting a bean. (Similar to how points are injected into a triangle)
	The injection can be done 'byType' as there is only one bean of type messageSource.
		getMessage is a method of the messageSource interface
		
	A message key can be made up of static text or dynamic objects. D
	
		Static text		-	drawing.circle=Circle drawing :
		Dynamic text	- 	drawing.point=Circle : Point is ({0} , {1})
	
	Objects are passed to the dynamic parameters via an array :

		messageSource.getMessage(	"drawing.point", 
									new Object[] {center.getX() , center.getY()}, 
									"Default point method", 
									null	);
