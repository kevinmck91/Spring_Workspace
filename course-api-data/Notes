1.	create a new Maven project, Create the Application class and copy over the topics package from the previous class 
	(add in the annotation @ComponentScan) in order to add the copies package to the spring config
	
2. 	We need to map the topic class to the relational database table. This is done via annotations 
	Mark the topics object as an entity and the JPA will know. (also mark the Primary Key

	We don't need to make a new "Service" class to read and write from the database - This already exists in spring.
	We just create an interface that uses the pre-existing class - CrudRepository 
	The CrudRepositry class has to be parameterised with the Class that is being saved and the primary key.
	The repository is now ready to be used in the TopicService class.
