	2. Added the Jars to the project
	
	Spring is a container of beans in the same way Tomcat is a container of servlets.
	Spring manages the objects lifecycle
	Object is actually created by string (as opposed to being created via a normal instantiation)
	
	Factory Pattern - 
	You write code to ask the spring container to instantiate the object and then pass it to another object for use
	You have object A that required object B. Instead of creating object B you make a call to the 'factory object' which will create object B and pass it to object A.
	This is done via the configuration settings (blueprint)(Spring XML) on the factory object
	Spring can then manage the entire lifecycle of this newly created bean
	
	
		The bean factory is an interface and there are different implementation classes 
		We will configure the bean factory using an XML file
		There are different types of bean factory's 
		XmlBeanFactory takes in an argument which is the actual resource (spring.xml)
		Spring.xml has the blueprint for the new objects
		The ID is the reference to the bean.
		When the bean factory is instantiated, it will go to the XML file, search for the ID and create the corrosponding class.
