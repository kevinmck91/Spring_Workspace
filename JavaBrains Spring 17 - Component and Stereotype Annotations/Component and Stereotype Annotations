	SpringDemo17 - Component and Stereotype Annotations
	
	We can have certain configurations in the circle class (instead of the xml) and wire them via annotations
	
	We need to tell spring what classes of ours are going to be beans.
	
	Whenever spring sees a class with the annotation @Component we can remove the bean from the xml as its not needed.
	
	Disadvantage of Annotations :
	There are 3 beans in the XML that use the same class. Since the annotation is part of the class, you can only have one type of Spring bean (instead of 3)
	Wont work for the 'point' class, these must be declared in the XML

	A tag is required to tell spring to search through the package for any class that might have the  @Component annotation
		<context:component-scan base-package="">
		
	<context:component-scan base-package=""> searches for a few other annotations, not just @Component. These are called Stereotypes
	
	Instead of @Component we could have @Service from the Stereotype package (it give the developer more details as to what the bean/class is or does).
	Adds a level of documentation, Also tied to Aspect orientated programming
	An @Component tag is ambigious, 
	if its a service class, use @Service, 
	if its a data class, use @Repository, 
	if its a controller, use @Controller
