	SpringDemo16 - JSR-250 Annotations
	
	JSR-250 is a standard that is not specific to spring
	
	@Resource is not specific to spring, ie not imported from a spring package
	
	It allows you to wire a bean by name. in this case the center point of the circle
		@Resource(name="zeroPoint")
		
	if you declare the @Resource without a name, it will search the beans for a member variable itself (similar to autowire by name)
	
	
	JSR-250 also has init and destroy method annotations (no xml or interfaces needed)
	
	The destroy method wont run unless you have the shutdown hook (which requires AbstractApplicationContext)
