	SpringAop02 - PointCuts & Wildcards
	
	Pointcut is when you have multiple aspect Advices running for a single method in a class
	
	If you want a set of Advices to run every time that any method in a circle class is triggered 
		
		@Pointcut("within(org.javabrains.model.Circle)")
		public void allCircleMethods(){}

		
		execution - Takes in a method name
		within	  - Takes in a class name
		args	  -	Takes in arguments if a method Requires them  
		
	Best practice -  Combine pointcut expressions : 
	
		@Before("allGetters() && allCircleMethods()")
		public void SecondAdvice(){
			System.out.println("This advice will run when a get method is called AND a circle method is called");
		}
