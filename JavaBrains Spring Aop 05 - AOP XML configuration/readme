	SpringAop05 - AOP XML configuration
	
	We will transfer the current Aspect file to run from our Spring XML -
	No annoations needed
	
	The annotations for the aspect are found within spring XML using the <aop:config> tab
	The bean that created the aspect as part of the Spring program is still required
	
	1. We need to remove @Aspect and transfer it to XML
		<aop:aspect id="loggingAspect" ref="loggingAspect"></aop:aspect>
		
	2. The @Pointcut contains two bits of info. The Name and the Expression
		This can be transfered to the XML within the above tags
		<aop:pointcut expression="execution(* get*())" id="allGetters"/>
		
	3. The @Around can be transfered to the XML
		<aop:around pointcut-ref="allGetters" method="myAroundAdvice"/>
		
	If you don't want to have a pointcut, you can delete the <aop:pointcut> tag and declare it inline 
	in the <aop:around> tag
		<aop:around pointcut="execution(* get*())" method="myAroundAdvice"/>
		
	The other annotations can be configured in XML with the same structure
	Legacy code is normally in XML
	Annotations are simple and more readable
