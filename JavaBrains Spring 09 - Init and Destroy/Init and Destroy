	If writing a destop app, you will need to close the context
	context.registerShutdownHook(); - tells spring to close the context when the application ends
	(required for init and destroy methods)
	
	By adding the interface, spring will run the init/destroy method when the bean is initilized and destroyed
	when the main method ends, the shutdown hook gets called and the beans get destroyed. finally the method is called
	
	The interface is not required. the init and destroy methods can be defined in the spring.xml
	you must : 
	 - Create a public method in the triangle class that you want to be an init or destroy method
	 - change the bean definition to : <bean id="triangle" class="org.javabrains.Triangle" init-method="myInitMethod">
	 - 									<bean id="triangle" class="org.javabrains.Triangle" init-method="myInitMethod" destroyMethod="myDestroyMethod">
	 
	 The init and destroy method can be set globally for all beans (as opposed to one or two beans) (when in the xml)
	 
	 <beans default-init-method="myInit">
	 		<bean></bean>
	 		<bean></bean>
	 		<bean></bean>
	 		
	 The interface methods are called first and spring.xml second if both are supplied
