	Having the application create the triangle bean is fine but not utilising the full power of spring.
	The app is dependent on the triangle class
	
	Instead, you can create a shape interface and use that in the App instead. The app doesn’t have to know which draw method it is using
	
	The interface has a method that all the shape object have to implement
	
	We have
	- Triangle class dependant on 3 point object and implementing the Shape interface
	- Circle class dependant on 1 point object and implementing the Shape interface
		
		
	For every object that we create, we have to write the object definition in the Spring XML
	
	advantages :
	when createing a new class, you just have to drop in the class, change the spring xml and drawing App will draw different shapes
	Doesnt tie the App to certain classes, only to one interface
	acts as a in-between for the view layer (app) and the business layer(classes)
	The view layer doenst have to be changed, only the wiring of the xml so the class can use it
