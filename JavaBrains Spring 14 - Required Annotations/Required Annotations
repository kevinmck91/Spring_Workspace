	SpringDemo14 - Required Annotations
	
	If the circle bean is empty (has no properties and no values), The circle object will not populate that values (they will default to NULL)
	When the drawing app tries to print the values, there will be an null pointer exception thrown and the application will not work
	This error is caused because the dependancys are not met. 
	 
	You need to validate that the dependancies are met before deploying the applicatiion
	Let spring know that the 'center' point cannot be null when the app runs. 
	Spring must validate that there is some bean that will populate the 'center' value. ie, the setter must run
	
	We want the exception to be thrown when the application is initilized (not when in use)
	
	Use the annotation @Required on the center setter  
	you will also have to declare a BeanPostProcessor in the Spring xml as its a beanPostProcessor that is doing the validation
	
	The bean:
		<bean class="org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.RequiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor">
		</bean>
	Will check for the @required tag
	
	The error will not flag in the application but in the bean itself 
		"Property 'center' is required for bean 'circle"
